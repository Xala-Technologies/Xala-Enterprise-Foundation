## ðŸ”— Dependencies for Other Packages

Once Foundation is complete, these packages can begin implementation:

1. **Authentication** - Depends on config-loader, logger, error-handler
2. **Monitoring Services** - Depends on metrics-sdk, logger, healthcheck
3. **Security Compliance** - Depends on logger, event-core, metrics-sdk
4. **Platform Services** - Depends on all foundation modules

**Critical Path**: Foundation package completion blocks all other package development, making this the highest priority implementation.
