## ðŸ”— Integration Dependencies

### **Requires Foundation Package**

- `config-loader` for Norwegian provider configuration
- `logger` for security audit trails
- `error-handler` for authentication error management
- `event-core` for authentication event publishing

### **Enables Other Packages**

- **Security Compliance** - Uses authentication for access control
- **Norwegian Services** - Uses authentication for government API access
- **UI System** - Uses auth-ui-helpers for authentication components
- **Platform Services** - Uses authentication for service protection

**Critical Path**: Authentication package enables secure access to all Norwegian government services and must be completed before government API integrations.
