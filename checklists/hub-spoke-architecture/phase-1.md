## üìã **IMPLEMENTATION TASKS**

### **Story 1: Foundation Structure Analysis (3 points)**

- [ ] Analyze current foundation package structure and capabilities
- [ ] Review packages/ui-system/src/modules/ for localization components to move
- [ ] Review packages/security-compliance/src/modules/ for compliance utilities to move
- [ ] Document current inter-package dependencies and communication patterns
- [ ] Create detailed migration map showing what moves where

### **Story 2: Foundation Module Enhancement (5 points)**

- [ ] Create `src/modules/localization/` directory in foundation
- [ ] Create `src/modules/compliance/` directory in foundation
- [ ] Create `src/modules/security/` directory in foundation
- [ ] Create `src/modules/utils/` directory in foundation
- [ ] Create `src/modules/events/` directory for event bus system
- [ ] Update foundation's main index.ts to export new modules

### **Story 3: Move Localization from UI-System (5 points)**

- [ ] Copy localization modules from ui-system to foundation/src/modules/localization/
- [ ] Create foundation/src/modules/localization/norwegian/ subdirectory
- [ ] Create foundation/src/modules/localization/translations/ subdirectory
- [ ] Create foundation/src/modules/localization/providers/ subdirectory
- [ ] Update all localization imports to use foundation
- [ ] Remove localization from ui-system after migration
- [ ] Test localization functionality works from foundation

### **Story 4: Move Compliance from Security-Compliance (5 points)**

- [ ] Copy compliance modules from security-compliance to foundation/src/modules/compliance/
- [ ] Create foundation/src/modules/compliance/nsm/ subdirectory
- [ ] Create foundation/src/modules/compliance/gdpr/ subdirectory
- [ ] Create foundation/src/modules/compliance/digdir/ subdirectory
- [ ] Update all compliance imports to use foundation
- [ ] Test compliance utilities work from foundation

### **Story 5: Create Event Bus System (3 points)**

- [ ] All moved components maintain their existing functionality
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] All tests pass after migration
- [ ] Norwegian compliance standards maintained throughout migration
- [ ] Event bus system operational and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated for new foundation structure

## üöß **TESTING REQUIREMENTS**

- [ ] Unit tests for all moved modules pass
- [ ] Integration tests verify cross-module functionality
- [ ] Norwegian compliance validation tests pass
- [ ] Event bus system tests verify publish/subscribe functionality
- [ ] Performance tests show no degradation from moves

## üìù **DELIVERABLES**
