- [ ] Update any remaining imports from security-compliance to foundation
- [ ] Remove security-compliance package from workspace configuration
- [ ] Update README files and documentation to remove references
- [ ] Clean up pnpm-workspace.yaml to exclude security-compliance
- [ ] Test that all compliance functionality works from foundation

### **Story 2: Consolidate Admin Packages (4 points)**

- [ ] Analyze saas-admin-panel, tenant-admin-panel, and design-system-admin packages
- [ ] Create single consolidated admin-panel package using foundation
- [ ] Move all admin functionality to single package location
- [ ] Update UI components to use foundation's localization and compliance
- [ ] Remove individual admin packages after consolidation
- [ ] Test consolidated admin interface maintains all functionality

### **Story 3: Evaluate Platform Services Package (3 points)**

- [ ] Review platform-services modules for essential functionality
- [ ] Move documentation module to foundation or dedicated docs package
- [ ] Move license module to foundation as utility
- [ ] Move performance monitoring to monitoring-services package
- [ ] Decide on platform-services elimination or transformation
- [ ] Update any dependencies on platform-services

### **Story 4: Evaluate Test Infrastructure Package (2 points)**

- [ ] Move essential test utilities to foundation/testing/ module
- [ ] Update central jest.config.js to include moved utilities
- [ ] Remove test-infrastructure package if no longer needed
- [ ] Update testing documentation and patterns

### **Story 5: Final Architecture Validation (2 points)**

- [ ] Verify final package count matches target (8-9 packages maximum)
- [ ] Confirm all packages depend only on foundation
- [ ] Test complete build pipeline with new structure
- [ ] Validate Norwegian compliance across simplified architecture
- [ ] Update root README with new architecture documentation
- [ ] Create deployment documentation for simplified structure

## ‚úÖ **PHASE COMPLETION CRITERIA**

- [ ] Package count reduced to 8-9 packages maximum
- [ ] Security-compliance package completely eliminated
- [ ] Admin packages consolidated to single admin-panel
- [ ] All redundant packages removed or consolidated
- [ ] Foundation serves as single dependency for all packages
- [ ] Build pipeline optimized for parallel package builds
- [ ] Documentation updated for new architecture

## üöß **TESTING REQUIREMENTS**

- [ ] Full monorepo build completes successfully
- [ ] All Norwegian compliance features working from foundation
- [ ] Admin interface fully functional after consolidation
- [ ] Event-driven communication working across all remaining packages
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet or exceed previous architecture

## üìù **DELIVERABLES**

- [ ] Streamlined 8-9 package architecture
- [ ] Updated workspace configuration files
- [ ] Consolidated admin interface
- [ ] Architecture documentation and migration guide
- [ ] Norwegian compliance certification for new structure
- [ ] Deployment scripts for simplified architecture
